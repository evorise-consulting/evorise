                <p>Effective programming in rural areas depends on high-quality data, yet this is often the most challenging to collect. "Noisy" data—characterized by inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and gaps—can lead to flawed project design and ineffective interventions. Our approach combines technology (like GIS and mobile data collection) with deep-seated community engagement to triangulate information, reduce noise, and generate reliable insights. This ensures that our strategies are based on a true understanding of local realities.</p>
