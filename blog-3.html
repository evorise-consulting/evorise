                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to revolutionize Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL). From analyzing vast datasets to identify patterns and predict outcomes, to automating data collection through satellite imagery and sentiment analysis, AI offers powerful tools to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of MEL. At Evorise, we are exploring how to ethically and effectively integrate AI into our MEL frameworks to provide our clients with deeper, more timely insights into their program's impact.</p>
